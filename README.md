This is a Lua library to add basic structural pattern matching (as in ML, Prolog, Erlang, Haskell, etc.).

**Basic usage:**

    require "tamale"
    local V = tamale.var
    
    local m = tamale.matcher { {pat1, res1}, {pat2, res2}, ... }
    m(pat2) --> res2

For example, rather than writing a series of nested ifs to test
for a structure such as { "point", x=3, y=-0.8, z=1.4 }, you can just
include the row
    { { "point", x=V"X", y=V"Y", z=V"Z" }, function_that_takes_captures }
in a series of match declarations (where V is a local alias to
*tamale.var*). The function would be passed a table with X, Y, and Z
keys and the numbers. Also, the capture table always includes the entire
matched pattern as t[1].

Each row can have an optional keyword argument of *where*=*f(cs)*. This
passes the captures to a function which returns whether those captures
are acceptacle (true/false). For example,
    { "email", V"address", where=valid_address(t) }
and valid_address checks if t.address is a valid e-mail address.
(Any errors during this function are treated as implicit failure.)

Finally, each variable can occur multiple times in the pattern. If the
values assigned to the same variable do not match, it will fail. For
example, { V"A", V"B", V"C", V"B" } would match both {1, 2, 3, 2} and
{"x", "y", "z", "y"}, but not {1, 2, 3, 4} or {"x", "y", "z", "a"}.
Variables whose names begin with _ are ignored.

If you are using tables as identifiers (e.g., "MAGIC_ID = {}"), then
add them to the optional ids={MAGIC_ID, ...} field on the match
spec table. This causes them to be compared by identity rather than
structure.

Currently, the library uses *linear search* - While some redundant
work occurs with highly repetitive tables, the overhead is still
low. I tried compiling the match spec to CPS-based decision tries, but
benchmarks showed very little improvement, and the compilation still
occured at runtime. Given the added complexity, I just removed it.

For further usage examples, see the test suite. Also, as this is a
technique imported from other, more declarative, languages, its real
potential may be better understood by studying them direcly.
